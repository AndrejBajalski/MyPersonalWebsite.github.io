<h1>Welcome to my personal website.</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Andrej and I'm an enthusiastic young developer in the making. This semester I started learning the basics of web-design and with my newly-acquired skills in HTML and CSS, I decided to create this webpage where you can learn something more about me and my life.</p>

    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I'm a 19-year-old student, born in Skopje, Macedonia and currently, I'm completing my first year of studies at the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering. What I find most enjoyable is spending time with friends, meeting new people, travelling, riding bike, learning languages and playing chess. My personal values are based on respect, honesty, selflessness and kindheartedness, while the driving force behind my success is my desire for learning new things, high ambition and extreme dedication to work.
    Since my early childhood, I have always been passionate about mathematics, physics and science because the problem-solving nature of these fields opened a great interest to me. When I first came in contact with programming at High School, I rapidly grew fond of Computer Science, which is why I chose to embark on my current studies on Software Engineering. Some of the goals I have in mind at the moment, during my studies and after their completion, include going on an international exchange, gaining great expertise in full-stack development and getting further involved in the faculty's working structure.</p>

<h1>Travel</h1>
    <p>I love traveling. Probably the most memorable were my travels to Italy, where I visited Rome, Naples, Florence, Venice, as well as the south of Italy. I've been to other great metropolises in Europe too, and last summer I had my first visit in Africa-Tunisia! Here are some of my most memorable highlights...</p>
